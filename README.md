# Web-Design-Challenge
This is a GitHub Repository which will hold files for the Module 11 Challenge (Web Design Challenge).

Here we create a website to hold visualizations for weather data.
First, we have a landing page which holds image links for each visualization page.
Clicking on those images will take you to the page with the visualization's information.
This exists for Latitude against maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.
There also exists a comparisons page, where we can compare the visualizations against one another
to see differences between the plots.
Ordinarily, this page would show two rows with two columns holding the visualization images,
and when you shrink the window, it should show one column of 4 rows of visualization images,
but I was unable to perform the last portion of shrinking the window.
And lastly, there is a data page with a table showing the data used to create these visualizations.
